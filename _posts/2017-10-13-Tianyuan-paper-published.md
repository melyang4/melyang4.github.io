QF and I have published the Tianyuan paper! (Finally!) 

Some lessons learned:

1. The less supplementary text, the better. 
2. Editors think removing 31 single spaced pages of supplementary text is a minor edit. 
3. Ordering of funding sources actually matters in China.
4. Ditto for order of affiliations. 
5. Helvetica fonts in all the figures!
6. Powerpoint is surprisingly flexible for creating original figures. 

A pdf copy can be found [<A HREF="https://github.com/melyang4/files_about_me/blob/master/yangetal2017.pdf">here</A>], but if you don't want to work your way through the article, we wrote a short press release for our institute, and that link is [<A HREF="http://english.ivpp.cas.cn/rh/rp/201710/t20171013_183890.html">here</A>]. 

If you can read or understand Chinese, here's a couple more links:
