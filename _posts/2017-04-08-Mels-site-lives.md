After five years of thinking and talking about it, I have finally made myself a site! 

Thanks HW for suggesting I use github (or really, gitpages) to host it. Furthermore, thanks JS and the terrible failure of working on a server based in China while living in the US of A for finally tackling git and github. Lastly, I'd still be wandering the tubes and trying to figure out how to do more than print text to the [homepage](https://melyang4.github.io/) without the awesome guide I found [here](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). 

Now comes the actual work, actually adding interesting content. But this is one small step for me, and one large step for...ok, yea, I'll just stop here.

Stay tuned!
