title: "Genomics of Ancient Modern Humans Review Paper"

The review QF and I wrote about the work in the last few years to understand the biological history of ancient modern humans using their aDNA is out!

Some lessons learned:

1. Nomenclature is hard.
2. Everyone, I'm sorry - Ust'-Ishim is from western Siberia and Kostenki14 is in western Russia. We didn't notice until after the proofs.
